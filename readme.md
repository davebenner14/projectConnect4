## General Overview

<font size="4">

Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.

## Controls

<font size="4">
This version of Connect Four is a point and click version. It is on a 4x4 grid. All playable columns will be highlight in grey, and when column is clicked, your playing piece will automatically be played at the bottom of the corresponding column. If a column is full, an alert message will inform you of such. If there is a winner or tie, there will be an alert message as well. There is also a "restart button" available.
